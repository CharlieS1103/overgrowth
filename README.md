# Overgrowth

A desktop application to handle the mass modification of icons and cool plugins to integrate with many different os's

## Plans:
* First i obiously need to get the base functionality in (changing of icons and storage of data that will be needed)
* Polish all the code and take the time to actually learn rust.
* Create an embedded scripting language so users can make plugins that can be installed by the users through the UI
* Create an actual UI

## Additional Notes

This roject is likely very messy and could use some refining, I took on this project which in my own personal opinion is a tad gargantuan without much (or any) experience with rust and have slowed down progress on it quite a bit.
If you'd like to contribute feel more than welcome, but this is a forewarning that you will likely see objectively bad code at some point and feel more than free to call me out on it.

### IMPORTANT: 
Do not run this code unless you are a delevoper or gambler, it does not work at all yet and will probably mess some stuff up.

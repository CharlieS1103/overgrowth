# Overgrowth

A desktop application to handle the mass modification of icons and cool plugins to integrate with many different os's

## Plans:
* First i obiously need to get the base functionality in (changing of icons and storage of data that will be needed)
* Polish all the code and take the time to actually learn rust.
* Create an embedded scripting language so users can make plugins that can be installed by the users through the UI
* Create an actual UI
### IMPORTANT: 
Do not run this code unless you are a delevoper, it does not work at all yet and will probably mess some stuff up.

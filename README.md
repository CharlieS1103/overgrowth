# Overgrowth

A desktop application to grow vines on unnused applications over time.

## How it works:
* Tracks the amount of time where an app on your local computer is idle/not used.
* It effectively will loop through and store the original icon files in the directory set in the users config
* It will then check the access time of every application or shortcut(OS dependent) and modify the icons respesctively.

## Installation:
Coming Soon.
